Roadrunner.sh :

1) Runs the GP_mz_GS.C and needs Funciones.h and the initial state (Ground state of the initial trapping potential)

2) Runs the Mean.C which calculates the phase difference 

3) Plots: Probability density, phase and mean phase (space and time phase average ) vs potential depht (deep). It needs 3 gnuplot scripts.



Runner.sh :

1) Runs the Itime_Msearch_Old.C calculates the ground states at each time step of the trapping potential for a given potential depht. Needs the trapp as input.  

Note: Itime_Msearch.C core dumped!! for any depht (tryial of parallelization)

2) Runs the Fidelity2_Old.C Needs the ground states at each time. The time evolved states and the trapping at each time for a given potential depht. Calculates the fidelity.

Fidelity2.C (tryial of parallelization process)

3) Plots Fidelity_plot.plt for a given potential depht.
